cpap machine she was also given nebulizer treatments q 4h as well as chest pt the nebulizers were increased to q 1h due to the fact that she continued to have labored breathing due to persistent

hypothyroidism the patient was continued on outpatient medical regimen depression the patient was continued on lexapro per outpatient regimen it is recommended that she follow up with a therapist as

husband muscle weakness the patient did have profound muscle weakness and was evaluated by physical therapy and was found to have impaired functional mobility impaired musculoskeletal performance impaired gas exchange impaired endurance impaired ventilation and needed help with supine to sit however she was able to tolerate sitting in a chair for approximately one hour on motor exam her flexors and extensors of the lower extremities were at the knee at the ankle at the elbows and hips it was felt that this weakness was most likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy as well as
